ðŸš€ Understanding Python Variables and Data Types! ðŸš€
In Python, variables and data types are fundamental concepts that are essential for writing clean and effective code. Letâ€™s break them down:
1. Variables in Python:
A variable is a reserved memory location used to store data. Itâ€™s like a container that holds values for easy reference and manipulation.
â€¢	Naming Convention:
o	Variable names should start with a lowercase letter.
o	Use underscores to separate words in multi-word variable names (e.g., user_age, total_score).

2. How to Create a Variable:
To create a variable in Python, you simply use the assignment operator (=).
python
Copy code
age = 16
print(age)  # Output: 16

3. Examples:
Single Variable:
python
Copy code
name = "Mohan"
print(name)  # Output: Mohan
Multiple Variables:
python
Copy code
name = "Mohan"
age = 16
print(name, age)  # Output: Mohan 16

4. Data Types in Python:

Python has two main types of data types:

Built-in Data Types:
These are pre-existing types in Python.
â€¢	Numeric Types:
o	int (integer)
o	float (floating-point number)
â€¢	Boolean Type:
o	bool (True/False)
â€¢	None Type:
o	None (used to represent the absence of a value)

â€¢	Sequence Types:
o	str (string)
o	list (ordered collection of items)
o	tuple (immutable ordered collection)
o	set (unordered collection of unique items)
o	dict (key-value pairs)
o	range (a sequence of numbers)
